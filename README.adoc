= Tendrl Documentation

Welcome to the Tendrl project's documentation repository!

This repository contains documentation applicable to the Tendrl project as a
whole. This includes design and architecture documents, developer workflow
details etc. Codebase specific documentation is hosted in the same repository
as the code.


== How to use this repository?

The developement workflow document (development-workflow.adoc) applies to any
changes to the contents of this repository, as it does to any of the Tendrl
project codebases.

Should you want to send a pull request against this repository, please follow
these guidelines:

* Configure your editor to use a hard line break on 79 characters.
* Don't delete the vim modeline comment at the top of the files.
* Feel free to add editor specific configuration to the files you author. Just
  ensure that it doesn't break the asciidoc syntax ie. ensure that it's in a
  comment.
* Use http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] to validate the html output produced
  by the files you've written before committing them.

If you've never written asciidoc before, the
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[asciidoctor syntax
reference] is the best place to start. Jump into the more detailed
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[user manual] as you realise the need
for a feature beyond text formatting.
