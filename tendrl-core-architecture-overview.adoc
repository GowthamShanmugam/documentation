= Tendrl Core Components Overview

Tendrl Core Stack provides the essential provisioning, management and
monitoring capabilities to the supported Storage Systems. The most important
design principle is that the Core stack should never be affected by the failure
of any other Stacks that integrates with it. The Core Stack must always be
self-sufficient.

== Responsibilities of the Individual Core Components

=== Tendrl App (App)

* Frontend/northbound API.
* This is the integration point for any external management system/frontend
  with Tendrl, including the Tendrl UI.
* The App has the necessary logic to understand the state definitions stored in
  the Central Store and present them over it’s API.
* The App has the necessary logic to be able to invoke Operations through the
  Central Store’s Job Queue implementation.
* The App is completely stateless. All the state is stored in the Central
  Store. The App essentially acts as a translation proxy between an external
  system (including Tendrl UI) and the Central Store.
* The App is intended to be primarily used for systems integration. As such,
  the API is completely generic and self descriptive. The intended use case is
  that any system wishing to leverage Tendrl uses the API’s descriptive
  responses to construct targeted queries for a specific cluster instances
  being managed by Tendrl.

=== Central Store (Store)
* The Store is a key-value object store that contains all the state information
  for a Tendrl based deployment.
* The Store contains:
** Storage System State Information in the Storage System’s own representation,
   without a pre-defined schema.
** Storage System State Definition, which is a YAML file that describes the
   access methods, data types and the general layout of the State Information.
** Operations hierarchy, which is a Job Queue. This also includes updates
   regarding the Operations being executed.
** Status of every relevant Tendrl and Storage System process/component that
   needs to be monitored.
** Current time series data needed for automated conditional triggers.
** Provisioning templates.
** YAML descriptions for each of the Operations specific to every instance of
   the Storage Systems being managed.
* Nothing ever happens anywhere in the Tendrl deployment, without it being
  written to the Store first.

=== Tendrl Node Agent (Agent)

* Primarily handles deployment host based operations.
* For a host to be managed by Tendrl, an Agent has to run on that host and it
  must be able to convey it’s own status to the Central Store.
* Agents are responsible for all operations local to the host they’re on, such
  as:
** Hardware interface via an external tool/library. This includes local disk
   management.
** Process monitoring for the various system and Storage System daemons,
   including the Tendrl Bridge via systemd.
** Invocation of host-local Provisioning Operations.
** Monitoring and gathering of the system’s status, including collection of
   time series data.
* Agents also co-ordinate cluster-wide Operations. One of the Agents becomes a
  temporary master for an Operation and ensures the appropriate distribution to
  other Agents. All of this is co-ordinated via the Central Store.

=== Tendrl SDS Bridge (Bridge)

* Provides Tendrl integration for a specific Storage System instance.
* Bridge is responsible for maintaining the Storage System state in the Central
  Store.
* Bridge implements any of the supported Operations to be carried out
  against the Storage System’s own management interface (CLI, API etc.)
